With future climate change drought in the Amazon forest may become more
frequent and severe. Rain shortages can turn Amazon regions from rain forests into
savanna, leading to high amounts of carbon released into the atmosphere.
Therefore, predicting future rainfall and understanding the underlying mechanisms 
are of great interest. @ciemer2020early established an 
early warning indicator for water deficits in the central Amazon basin (CAB) based on tropical Atlantic sea surface 
temperatures (SSTs). Inspired by their work, this thesis aims to build up on this work and improve its
predictive power by using different statistical methods.
Here we seek to build a model that can predict monthly precipitation based on the
sea surface temperatures. 
Also, we want to identify the most important sea regions for doing so, making interpretability a point of interest, too.
Firstly we will analyze the data descriptively to 
explore patterns and spatial dependencies.
Including a cluster analysis of the precipitation data
in the central Amazon basin.
Following, we will compare two different regression approaches
and their capability to predict precipitation and their interpretability of the SST regions selected by them.
The first model is the lasso, as proposed by @tibshirani1996regression. Comparing different model specifications, we will carry on the findings from the lasso
and fit a (sparse) fused lasso on the data (@tibshirani2005sparsity).
Both models are evaluated using a 5-fold forward selection,
a model evaluation technique that considers the time dependencies present in the data at hand.
Finally, we summarize the findings in this work 
and give an overview of strengths and limitations of the approaches used together with ideas for future research.


This thesis was written and supervised in cooperation with Dr. Niklas Boers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (@PIC) and Dr. Fabian Scheipl (LMU).
