# Introduction {-}

With future climate change droughts in the Amazon forest may become more
frequent and/or severe. Droughts can turn Amazon regions from rain forest into
savanna, leading to high amounts of carbon released into the atmosphere.
Therefore, predicting future droughts and understanding the underlying mechanisms 
is of great interest. @ciemer2020early, established an 
early warning indicator for droughts in the central Amazon basin (CAB), based on tropical Atlantic sea surface 
temperatures (SSTs). In my thesis I would like to build on this work and improve the 
predictive power by using different statistical methods.
Meaning, we seek to build a model that is able to predict droughts (resp. rainfall) based on preceding
sea temperatures, desirably with as much lead time as possible. Also we want to 
identify those sea regions that are most important for doing so, making interpretability a point of interest, too. A first model could be a cross-validated (generalised) LASSO approach
trying to identify the most important oceanic regions and the respective time-scales.

The thesis will be done in cooperation with Dr. Niklas Boers from the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (@PIC).
