1.1 Enabling low-carbon electricity

1.1.1 Variable resources

	electric grid: power generated must equal power consumed at every moment
	-> buffer needed when less energy generated than predicted.
	-> buffer often co2 emitting, spinning reserve
	-> future: batteries, pumped hydro, power-to-gas!
	-> improve necessary technologies: forecasting, scheduling control

7 Climate Prediction

Predominant predictive tools; climate models aka General Circulation Models (GCMs) / Earth System 
Models (ESMs) -> IPCC reports, calculate climate risks, estimate poptential impacts of solar 
geoengineering.

7.1 Uniting data, ML, and climate science

7.1.1 Data for climate models
	
	sensor calibration , classification of observational data,... [474-481]
	gescience problems, eps [481] specific advice on fitting and over-fitting climate data.

7.1.2 Accelerating climate models

	ML models can help solving systems relying heavily on physical laws f.e thermdynamics
	efficiently

!!	clouds and aerosols [485] for examples

	Ice sheets and sea level rise

7.1.3 Working with climate models

	Nowack et al.: ozone concentrations can be computed as a function of temperature
	-> computational savings

!!	Anderson and Lucas [491] random forests for high-resolution predictions, from mix of high 
	and low resolution models
!	Climate Modeling Alliance [495]



7.2 Forecasting extreme events

Extreme event prediction: warning to stockpile food etc. weather forecast are shorter-term,
but produce abundant (a lot of) data. Weather models can be tested every day. Climate models
are chaotic in short-term but reliable in long-term.

!!! extrem weather forecasting review [500]

7.2.1 Storm tracking

7.2.2 Local forecasts

7.3 Discussion
	
	ML models will be most successful if closely intergrated into existing scientific models
	leverage existing knowledge to make good predictions. Best models likely to be built
	by close-knit temas including both climate and computational scientists.

8 Societal impacts

ecological and socioeconomic stresses, brief but severe societal disruptions.
How do we reduce vulnerability to climate impacts?
How do we support rapid recovery from climat-induced disruptions?

Societal adaption:
	Sounding alarms: Identifiying, prioritizin areas of highest risk
	Providing annotation: Extracting actionable information
	Promoting exchange: Make it easier to share resources and information

Ecological awareness, resilient infrastructure, crisis readiness, social systems

8.1 Ecology

	Monitoring ecosystems:  
	to preserve ecoystem, gotta know which are at risk
	remote sensing data (tree cover from aerial imagery, regions or biomes by 
	large scale simulations), especially environmental sensor networks.
	"personalize" predictions across a range of ecosystems.
	transfer learning, rapid generalization, anomaly detection, missing data imputation
!!	design of effective methods for ecoysystem monitoring

	Monitoring biodiversity:
	species population estimates are foundation on which conservsation efforts are build.
	camera traps etc. ML infer biodiversity counts from image-based sensors.f.e.[536+1]
	see also [550-552]

8.2 Infrastructure

	Infrastructure is ubiquitous, has to be rethought -> tough one.
	Changing climate and weather conditions will affect infrastructure and damage.
	ML can help in design and maintenance.

	Designing infrastructure: 
	incorporate flood hazards, localize vulnerable road net points, water infrastructure
	
	Maintaining infrastructure:
	what systems can work well under stress? -> predictive maintenance and anomaly detection
	predictive maintenance: operations are prioritized according to predicted probability of
	near-term breakdown. 
	anomaly detection: failures are discovered as soon as they occur.
	Data is plentiful, but difficult to glue together.
	Fields: missing data, multimodal data, AutoML

8.3 Social systems

	Social systems are endangered when climate change affects, food supply, and communities
	that rely more on ecosystem resources.

!!	Food security:
	near-term shortages, evtl get info from mobile phones, credit-card transactions, social 
	media data.[578-589] f.e using mobile phone data and aritime credit purchases to estimate
	food security.
	crop yield predictions, generated by aerial imagery/ meteorological data.[583-585]
	on the ground drop-disease identification from plant photos.
	even simulate crop yield via biological and ecological models.

	Resilient livelihoods:
	ML systems can guide equipment and iformation sharing in farming cooperatives via
	growers social networks.[594]  Solomon Assefa. Hello Tractor pilot agriculture 
	digital wallet based on AI and blockchain.
	Mobile money efforts increase access to liquid purchasing power, also can monitor 
	economic health. 

	Supporting displaced people:
	predict large scale migration patterns. protecting refugees, improve rescue operations
	monitor negative public senitment. 
	
	Assessing health risks:
	two most expected shifts are, heat waves and outdoor and indoor air quality will detoriate
	-> effect [609-622]

8.4 Crisis

	Disaster response and public health can benefit from ML methodology.[623-625]
	Human computation for disaster response.
	Big crisis data: social media in disasters and time-critical situations
	Publich health informatics : improving and transforming public health in the information	
	age.

	Managing epidemics:

	Disaster response: create maps from aerial imagery and performing information retrieval
	social media data. Maps inform evacuation planning, retrofitting campaigns, delivery of relief.
	Pre and post disaster comparison.
	Socil media data can contain insight, missing ressources etc


11 Collective decisions

Includes many kind of actions, the systems involved are extremely complex. Use 
methods such as policy analysis, operations research, economics, game theory, computational
social science. 

11.1 Modeling social interactions

	Agent-base models. Simulate actions and interactions of agents in their environment.
	f.e 	modeling rooftop solar adaption.[712]
		modeling behaviour and norms change with external pressures[715]
		how economy and climate may evolve due to political and economic beliefs[716]
		modeling migration in response to env change
	often hand designed by experts, ML can help_
	f.e	integrate data-driven insight[718], by learning rules, or unsuperv VAE/ GAN
	but loose interpretability -> interpretable ML!

	also techniques from game theory, multi-agen reinf learning, mechanism design ("inverse
	game theory)
!!!	paper[720-725]


11.2 Informing policy
	
	policies needed at local, national and international level.
	Policy Analysis - evaluatie outcomes of past policies and assessing future policy alternatives

	Gathering data:
	create policies -> negotiate fundamental uncertainties -> ML can provide data
	pinpoint source of emissions, approximate traffic patterns, identify infrastr at risk,
	mine information from companies' financial disclosures.
!!!	NLP, network analysis, clustering -> analyze media data -> understand public opinions around
	climate change.[729-731]
	--> use these data to identify areas of intervention compute benefits and costs of a project,
	evaluate effectiveness of policy after it has been implemented.

	Assessing policy options:
	Comp approaches can bes used to compare different policy options, propose strategies ec.
!!	Integrated assessment models (IAMs) see [732] for an overview
	ML can help via clustering methods, downscaling, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis,
	finding numerical solutions for comp exp submodels, assess validity of models.
!!!	Combinatorial optimization for decision making in operations research.[194] Overview Heavy
	Sheesh
	Descision making ML approach: decision making process as optim problem, combine multiple
	optim objectives subject to constraints. Goal: find (set of) solution that is Pareto-optimal.
	-> apply bio-inspired algorithms, particle swarm, genetic or evolutionary alg.
	this has been applied in climate change related fields, energy and infrastructure lanning,
	industry, lanf use etc [111, 742-754]. Parallel surrogate search [755].
	Also hyperparam tuning [756+1]
	
!!!	Evaluating policy effects:
	Analyze previous policies, analyze political texts [759]
	Causal inference techniques [760-762], 
!!!	7 tools of causal inference, Machine learning in policy evaluation
	 new tools for causal inference
	policy problems analysis, climate relevant scenarios effect of temp on human mort [765]
	effect of worldbank proj on vegetative cover [766]
	
11.3 Designing markets

	GHG emissions, negative externality -> cost for society cost is not reflected in market price

	Predicting carbon prices:
	carbon taxes and cap-and-trade co2 certificate
	ML analyze prices, predicting prices via supervised learning, analyze main drivers of prices
	via hierarchical clustering
	
	Non-carbon markets:
	
!!	Assessing market effects:
