notes on "Emergent Inequality and Endegenous Dynamcis in a simple bahvioral macroeconomic model"

Abstract:
Single rational household makes savings decision, consume or invest.
household updates savings rate by copying the savings rate of neighbour with highest consumption
if update time is short, economy is stuck. for longer update times irregulat endogenous oscillations
-> resembles a business cycle -> result: poor households with los savings and rich household with
high savings -> inequality and economic dynamics occur spontaneously as consequence of imperfect
household decision making -> suggest behaviorally grounded decision making.

Intro:
Model shows that use of heterogenous agents following explicit behaviorral rules procudues
aggregate behavior that is qualitatively different from that of rational agents.
results suggest that approach should explicitly incorporate empirical behavioral knowledge
into household decision making.


Discussion:
primary purpose is to make conceptal point by demonstrating: emergent inequality and endegenous
dynamics can emerge naturally from a heterogenous behavioral model.
