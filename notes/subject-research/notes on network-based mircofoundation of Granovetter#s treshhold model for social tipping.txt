Notes on "A network-based microfoundation of Granovetter's threshold model for social tipping"

Abstract:
1. social tipping = minorities trigger larger populations to engage in collective action
2. granovetters theoretical threshold model, individual norms and preferences are crucial.
when presented with certain decision yes/no. every nodes has threshold, threshold measures
the proportion of the group that a individual would like to observe participating within 
collective behaviour before joining themself. usually no one or the entire populations is joining
-> unlike real world -> here never, always and eventually active agents
Network theoretical approaches
