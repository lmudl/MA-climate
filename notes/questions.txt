Zusammenfassung Paper OG:
1. unweighted static two variable coupled networks -> complete SST vs Rain -> 4 regions
	 use p-value cutoff for significant corr values
3. weighted two variable coupled networks -> 4 Regions vs Rain -> 24month sliding window approach -> ACC between each region and rain
4. Atlantic more important
5. ACC between STAO and NTAO use this for early warning system

? So here SST to predict droughts, but is SST generally enough for predicting rain ?
? Is it reasonable to create predictive model for drought index/ percipitation in general?

If so can we make model on the obersvational data such: SST -> drought/ percipitation -> biomassloss
	and then on model data: SST -> biomassloss
? Include equilibrium states for sensitivity ?

? Do we have obs data for biomasslos in amazons rainforest ?

Create sensitivity metric maybe for amazon 
	sst -> drought/ percipitation -> biomassloss
	meaning amazonas sensitivity to biomassloss, equilibrium stability
1. find fields that are predictive for rain
