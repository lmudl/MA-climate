Assumptions for emergent constraints

Uncertaint in ECS can be narrowed by using ECs, relates observable raviable to climate-model-simulated
	ECS.
fluctuation-dissipation-theorem: "relates mean response to impulsive external forcing of a dynamical
	system to its natural unforced variability.
Here: ECS is mean response to external forcing and measure of natural unforced variability
	is psi, metric of global mean temperature variability.
	Additionally: assumption, residual global-mean forcing time series is stationary, consists
		of mutually independent random quantities and global-mean temp is independent of
		previous year
-> Important to remove any non-random forced variability from modelled and observed time series
	before calculating psi
