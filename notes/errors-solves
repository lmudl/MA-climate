errors/warnings - solves

20.01.21
cdo("--version") gives:
Error in system2("cdo", cmd.args, stdout = TRUE) : '"cdo"' not found
solution:
Sys.getenv("PATH") # shows path
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"), "C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\",sep = ";")) # adds cdo location to path

21.01.21
file.remove() gives:
"data/interim/precip-interim2.nc"
solution:
I wanted to paste a 2 behind the filename, to solve that we can not save to the same file that 
	we are opening (at least with cdo operators that start with "-")
	But the 2 is not behind the filename but the .nc which gives .nc2, not good.
new <- strsplit(x = data/interim.precip-interim.nc, ".", fixed = TRUE)
paste0(new[1], "2.nc")

sst all zeros after mergetime
solution: raw/sst contained a test.nc file, deleting the file colved the issue
