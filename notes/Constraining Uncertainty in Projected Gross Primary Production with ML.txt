Constraining Uncertainty in Projected Gross Primary Production with ML

Here EC is already known

Abstract:
More CO2 -> more Gross Primaty Production = production of carbohydrates by photosynthesis
ESMs exhibit large range in projected GPP
Here combine EC with ML to constrain spatial variations of multimodel GPP projections
1st: Use observed changes in CO2 to constrain global mean GPP at end of 21st century
2nd: Use ML model to constrain gridded future and gridded fractional GPP change in two ind approaches
	feed observ data to ML alg. Model was trained on CMIP5 data to lern relationship betw 
		present-day relevant diagnostics and the target.
		CV shows superior results compared to CMIP5 ensemble mean

Summary and Discussions:
The presented approach based on machine learning is not limited to projections of the future carbon cycle,
 which was used as an illustrative example. Indeed, since its only prerequisites are the availability of g
ridded climate model data and gridded observation‐based data, the GBRT algorithm can be applied to any 
variable of interest if physically relevant diagnostics that influence the target variable are known. 
This opens a wide range of possibilities for constraining uncertainties in projected variable scenarios. 
Additionally, maps of the local relative feature importance as shown in Figure 7c can be used to reveal 
connections between different Earth system variables that are currently unknown. With the proposed data‐driven 
approach, a possibly extended application could be to constrain projections of not just one but several 
variables simultaneously. Moreover, the concept of our method is not limited to GBRT but can be used 
with any other (machine learning) regression algorithm.
