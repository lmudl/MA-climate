1.
use convolutional neural nets to predict the rainfall in the amazonas 
do this for every climate model
use each model to predict rainfall on the real data
the model that produces the best result stems from the most reasonable model

2. 
X sst, Y rainfall
X consists of pixels
Y consists of pixels? or do we put it together in a mean
Do we then create feature importance map to get most important pixels?
Or does each pixel get ID and IDs then might form a network

3.
how to include the different time scales/ time lags

4.
could also use attention mechanisms

5.
use sparse regression or
MDER: multiple diagnostic ensemble regression
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/29/2/jcli-d-15-0412.1.xml

6.
use inverse covariance matrix for network detection

7. !!!
need metrics for emergent constraint
y might be rainfall
x sst temperatures

SST field dipol apparent -> more rainfall sensitivity/ better prediction
X SST dipol sensitivity
Y predictability of rainfall


X SST dipol sensitivity
Y rainfall in the Amazonas

double Emergent Constraint
X correlation (SST dipol sensitivity) and (rainfall)
Y biomass loss in the rainforest

8. 
use graphical lasso and Stars

http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/graph.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3316.pdf
but we need longitudinal version, maybe:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08013
time varying networks

9.
correlate the average cross correlation with the percipitation
get time series, get sensitvity
use same procedure in climate models see how sensitive they are
plot sensitivity against biomass loss?
sst -> rainfall -> biomasslos
what about burning of the amazonas?

10.
are sst corrleations or acc only predictive for droughts
or for rainfall in general
