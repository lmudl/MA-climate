question:
can we use convergent cross mapping to determine which fields in the ocean influence which other fields?
can incorporating green lead are index or alike help to estimate, vaporisation or similar?
obs based constraint of permafrost loss: if climate stabilises at 1.5 degrees instead of 2, would save
	approximately 2 mio km^2 of permafrost.

general notes:
for expose: Ec is used to reduce uncertainties
1.5 instead of 2 degree increas -> influence on rainforest?
we probably dont need lot lan info if we firstly just fit a linear model, that uses only NTAO,STAO and
their half year preceeding values. Meaning: Precip_i = NTAO_i, STAO_i, NTAO_i-1, STAO_i-1,...,, NTAO_i-5, STAO_i-5
but we could also include  interactions, quatratics, logs etc. So lasso, cv and or stability paths would make sense
