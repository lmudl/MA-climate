notes on my cv function

target path
feature path

mean of target

add_colnames for features
add colnames adds the coordinates from the original sst data sa colnames

indices for train and test, maybe make own function here



cv_for_ts:

prepare sst or features
	drop all coordinates that contain only NA (is land not sea then)
get obs to dop, drop obs
	functions for finding and dropping observations according to time slices that will be 
	created for cv
createTimeSlices
	create the indices for the folds
get the lambda values
	lambda min and lambda max
	lambda max is the first lambda that forces all coefficients to be zero
	sfrom lambda max we derive lambda min and then get evenly spaced lambdas from there
for each fold
	create train and test
	fit model on train data
!!! glmnet(x_train, y_train why no lamda there)
