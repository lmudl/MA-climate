Analyse cluster results:
spatially coherent clusters
clusters 1 and 4 are a bit overlapped

cluster 3, mean lowest variability
cluster 2 and 5, middle, cluster 1 and 4 high variability

cluster 2 and 5 below mean
cluster 4 above mean
cluster 1 and 3 on mean but different variance

also see some clear outliers in cluster 1, 3 and 5


Glyph plots:
spatially coherent.
the closer the latitude to the equator the less precipitation

Notes:
check which variables get into the pca the most
