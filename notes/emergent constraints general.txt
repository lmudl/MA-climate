notes on emergent constraints general
https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/emergent-constraints

different climate models, give different answers about future climate
emergent constraints can be used to narrow the range of answers
basic concept: analyze large ensemble of climate model -> clear relationship emerges between variable X
	in current simulated climate and different variable Y in model's projection of future.
	when relationship tested in various ways -> plug in actual observations of variable X to narrow 
	the range of answers for variable Y.
