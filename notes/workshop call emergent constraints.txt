mark williamson: introduction to workshop
emergent constraintm constrain real world unknown using ensembles and observations
earth system sensitivity, trend or variation, prior infer-model uncertainty
emergent constraint: emergent relationship combined wih value of observable in real world
	imply a constraint on real world value of earth system sensitivity
	first ECs snow-albedo feedback
recent reviews: progressing emergent constraints on future climate change
	reductin uncertainties in cliate projection with emergent constraints
null hypothesis: they occur by chance and are not indicative of a deeper predictive mechanistic
	relationship
	danges of data mining and p-hacking
how might ECs go wrong and how to guard it:
	chance relationships
	overconfidence in constraints
	missing processes/ feedbacks in latest models
	compensating errors in models
	errors in obersvation/ obs not directly comparable

tipping points:
local bifurcation, example AMOC
noise induced tipping: dansgaard -oeschger events?
rate induced tipping: compost bomb
possible tipping point dieback of amazon rainforest
early warning signals of bifurcation tipping

manuel schlund (veronika eyring) DLR:
emergent constraints on ECS and carbon cycle feedbacks
example sherwood et al 2014, x-axis: lower tropospheric mixing index (LTMI)
schlund et al ESD 2020
for all but one constraint, best estimate/uncertainty ECS is higher in CMIP6, corr is lower in CMPI6
	likely related to higher multi-model men
emergent constraint on carbon-climate feedback
? should we also use different CMIP ensembles?
constraining uncertatinty with ML
	multi constrain multi-model projection of Y
	multivariate lineare regression
	schlund et al. JGR: Biogeosc (2020)
	machine learning-based weighting
	uncertainty is lower in ML technique
	evaluate feature importance

climate sensitivity and temperature variability
Psi introduced as a summary of variab in surfacte temp in time series
	non-linear and heteroskedastic -> problematic for OLS
if theres no uncertainty (perfect model) -> invertable
"what could we learn about climate sensitivity from variability in the surface temperature record?"
	www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/esd-2019-90
interannual variability in global mean temperature may contain some usable information
	but des not provide a tight constraint

Varney et al 2020 Nature Communications !!!
Soil carbon, uncertainties hera are key in uncertainties in global carbon budgets
increased carbon input in soil by forestation, output heterotrophic respiration
soil carbon turnover time
! spatial temperature sensibility
uncertainties in proj change in soil carbon storage are key components of the
	uncertatinties in the global carbon budgets for the Paris Agreement Targets
we use the real world spatial temp sensitivity to constrain a feature

For ECs physics needs to understood #1

number of independent samples in each CHMIP archive is too low, for power?
siler et al 2018
Caldwell et al 2018 (Jcli) method for identifying which feedbacks & regions lead to correlation
	between an emergent constraint ECS
evaluation of the physical mechanisms for constraints is important
? multivariate analysis of emergent constraints? sparse regression?
sherwood et al 2020, rev geophys
combine multiple emerging constraints
ridge regression, wuy not lasso regression?
what about stability paths?
emergent constraints produce higher ECS 
bretherton caldwell 2020; JCli
kalman equations? bayesian updating in the linear gaussian approximation
power calculations for emergent constraints?
what about bootrtrap?
