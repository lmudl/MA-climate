To do:
Get coordinates for boxes of general window of interest, STAO, NTAO and Amazon basin

Done:
General window of interest: 180 W - 3 W, 40 N - 40 S (degrees, lon lat)
	STAO/ NTAO?
	amazon basin: 10 S - 0, 70 W - 55 W
Wrote expose short for bjÃ¶rn
computed narrowed graphic for window of interest
Amazon basin first data has no values

05.01.20

precip data is complete already, but sst is separated in single files per month
download data from webpage with a function?


Done:
Get whole sst data, did it with down them all, but actually the read me contained 
	code on how to donwload alle the files


Todo:
see basic-correlation.R
check if values are apparent in latest file
Write preprocessing file for sst
	-> get filenames via list.files() DONE
	-> create list with filenames DONE
	-> loop through filenames DONE
	-> create path with filename in list DONE
	-> load data DONE
	-> add each sst file data as new dimension DONE
	? -> constrain to the window we need? Here or later? -> write function ?
		if we constrain then also to_be_filled needs to get other dimensions
	-> save data TODO


Check what time frames the data is in
	-> do EDA
Compute 1 correlation
Compute time series of correlations 
Compute mean 
Check values for different time lags
