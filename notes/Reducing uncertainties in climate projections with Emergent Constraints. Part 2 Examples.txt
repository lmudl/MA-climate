Earth's energy budget: accounts for balance between energy that Earth receives from the Sun
	and the energy the Earth radiates back into outer space after having been distributed through
	the five components of Earth's climate system.

convective mixing: vertical transport of a fluid and its properties.
	f.e sinking of cold, dense water and rising of warm less-dens aire
	during formation of clouds and hurricanes

The pioneers:
climate models + observations: Hall and Manabe 1999
first ECs: Allen and Ingram 2002
snow-albedo feedback: Hall and Qu 2006

Model biases and climate sensitivity:
Hall and Qu paved the way for seeking ECs in ECS
Voloding 2009: higher ECS -> larger differences in cloud cover between tropics and extra-tropics
	and lower tropical relative humidity
Sherwood et. al 2004: Spread in ECS vs strength of convective mixin in atmosphere (= sum between 
	index of small-scale mixing and index of large-scale mixing)
	take with caution but highlight that misrepresentation of tropical dynamics may explain 
		differences in ECS
Related to Tian 2005: links intensity of ITCZ bias to spread of ECS.
	Cloud processes highlighted as potential drivers of double ITCZ bias 
Sherwood and Tian suggest hidden relationships between low clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity

Cloud feedback:
many spreads are related to low cloud feedback -> constrain on low cloud feedback ->
	additionally many emergent constraints on ECS can be understood as encoding properties
	of shortwave low-cloud feedbacks
climate sensitivity from enery budget estimates suggest low ECs, but unvertatinty is too large
	to exclude much higher ECS
two other important cloud responses tat need to be sconstraint: changes in liquid water content
	high cloud feedback
merge realistic estimates of low-cloud amount, high-cloud amount to extratropical optical depth	
	feedbacks -> increase confidence in constraints on climate sensitivity from climate models

Climate change:
links between interannual variability of extreme precipitation and temperatures
	-> possible observable constaints, esp bc phys mechanisms are well understood
	-> usually suggest a stronger intensification of heavy rainfall with warming
also sensitivity of carbon cycle change

Paleoclimate simulations:
Earth's orbital variations induce global-mean temperature changes, can be used to quantify climate
	sensitivity.
Orbital variations + climate models -> different global-mean temperature responses.
	-> differences my be related to spread in ECS
	-> simulated global-mean coling during Last Glacial Maximum inversely correlated to ECS
		in CMIP 3 models
	-> constraint LGM cooling from proxy data -> lower climate sensitivity
Criticism: realism of LGM CMIP simulations, incertainty in temp inferred from proxies
	use of paleoclimate as surrogate for global warming,
	uncertainties may explain weak correlations between paleoclimate indices and climate
		projections and difficulty narowing spread from paleo base ECs

Perspectives:
Call for robust statistical inference for giving credible constraint estimates
