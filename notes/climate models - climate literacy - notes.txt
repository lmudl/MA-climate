notes on climate literacy - climate models

Intro Climate Models:

Climate models are what if scenarios
models let us plan ahead
climate model arrowa flow of energy and mass among the different parts
	static vs dynamic model
observe how perturbation riffles thourgh the system
test if model aligns well with real world observations, or revise the model
how proportion of vapour to liquid water changes with warming temperatures
other variables:
	rate at which CO2 exchanges in the ocean
	heat capacity of water
	average groth of trees eac year
	temperature profile of the atmosphere
climate models should align with reality
climate models:
	our attempts to represent Earth's climate system, so that we can better
	understand how it works, since we can't conduct whole-earth experiments.
	grounded in physics, chemistry, and biology
	constrained by observations in the real worlds, and inform further observational
	efforts
	even fairly simple climate models can help to understand climate

Choices Climate Modelers Make:

Spacial Choices: horizontal grid (latitude-longitude), vertical grid (height or pressure)
	model resolution (220 km) vs high-resolution models (50 ad 25 km) and observed data
Temporal Choices and Spacial Choices are dependent: higher resolution spacial -> also higher res temp
Parameterization: rather than explicitly model formation of droplets form vapor and specific clods
	use parametrization via air temperature and relative humditity to model relative cloud cover 
How much virtual time will be modelled?
Computational Costs/ Time to run a model:
	computer time for each math operation
	x # of math operations per equation
	x # of equations per grid cell
	x # of grid cells in the model
	x # of total time steps
	x # of model runs
Naomi Oresked: Complexity Paradox, complex model may be more realistic, but as we add more factors to
	a model the certainty of its predictions may decrease even as the intuitive faith in the 
	model increases. (does uncertainty add up?)

Climate Model Output:
Compare model output to observations helps check how well the models represent Earth's climate system.
Climate models have done well modeling global temperatures
In some cases models underestimated actual rates of change in climate system, f.e sea ice and sea level
	rise
model projectoins of future temperatures show high latidues and land contuining to warm faste than low
	latitudes and ocean.
