# in this script
# put it all together 
# or separate
# loading data, runnning cv, plotting cv err_mat, plotting cv maps
# also for fused_lasso different function no?
# also for spi or no?

# what do I want to run: 
# on deseasonalised data
# on original data
# compare on original data and on deseasonalised data after adding seasonality and
# and trend.

# predict full is original rain and original sst
# predict dec is deseasonalised or deseasonalised and detrended
# predict full/dec/dec+detr is one dimensions
# predict with or without correlation preselection is other variable

# cv dimensions with or without overlaps this and that

# so in best case it would be

# data loading
# cv-fit
# add saisonalities and then compute err-mat?
