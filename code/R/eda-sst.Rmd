In this notebook we want to explore the sst data from
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/extended-reconstructed-sea-surface-temperature-ersst-v5.

```{r load packages and check working directory}
library(ncdf4)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(assertthat)
```
```{r check working directory}
#TODO 
#should wd be ma-climate or should wd be where the markdown file is?
```

Maybe before EDA we have to bring the data together
load each file, get the data, restrict it to the
window we need and merge into one file. NICE WORK

```{r load data}
getwd()
sst_file <- nc_open("data/interim/sst-interim.nc")
sst <- ncvar_get(sst_file, "sst")
dim(sst)
```

```{r}
dim(sst)
new <- array(NA, dim = c(180,89,2))
new[, , 1] <- sst
```
```{r}
dim(new)
head(new[,,1])
```
